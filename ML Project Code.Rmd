1. Description of HAR data
```{r Data Descruption, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.height="50%", out.width="100px"}
library(knitr)
library(png)

options(knitr.graphics.auto_pdf = TRUE)
knitr::include_graphics("http://web.archive.org/web/20161025043219im_/http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/static/WLE/on-body-sensing-schema.png")
```
*HAR (human activity recognition) research has focused to predict "which" activity was performed at a specific point in time (like with the Daily Living Activities).*

*Weight Lifting Exercises dataset investigated "how (well)" an activity was performed by the wearer.*

*Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions:*
> exactly according to the specification (Class A) # correct
> throwing the elbows to the front (Class B)
> lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C)
> lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D)
> throwing the hips to the front (Class E)

*Participants were supervised by an experienced weight lifter to make sure that all participants could easily simulate the mistakes*

*Safe and controlled exercises by using a relatively light dumbbell (1.25kg).*

2. Data Processing
*Loaded required packages*
```{r Libraries, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(randomForest)
library(rattle)
```

### Data Clearning to prepare to get training set and testing sets
```{r Data Cleaning, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
training_data<-read.csv("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv",
                        na.strings = c("NA","#DIV/0!",""),header=TRUE,sep = ",")
#*Downloaded the training data from the given url, removed columns with blank cells and "#DIV/0!"*

trfun <- function(x){sum(is.na(x))}
trainSet<- training_data[sapply(training_data,trfun)==0] # removed the columns with all NAs
trainSet <- trainSet[,-c(1:7)] # removed first 7 columns as they are not necessary for prediction
```

3. Data Partitioned to create Training and Testing sets for model tuning
```{r Data Partition, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(1977)
Intrain <- createDataPartition(trainSet$classe,p=0.69,list = FALSE)
trainingOne <- trainSet[Intrain,]
testingOne <- trainSet[-Intrain,]
```

4. Applied ML algos/methods
(i). method = Decision tree (Recurssive Partitioning and Regression Trees)
```{r Decision Tree, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(1977)
library(rattle)
library(rpart.plot)

modelTree<- rpart(trainingOne$classe ~ .,data=trainingOne,method ="class")
fancyRpartPlot(modelTree,cex=0.4)

PredTree <- predict(modelTree,testingOne,type="class")
confusionMatrix(PredTree,testingOne$classe)
```
_Accuracy_of_ model_ = 74.51%

(ii). method = Random Forest
```{r RF, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(1980)
library(randomForest)
modelRF<- randomForest(trainingOne$classe ~ .,data=trainingOne)
modelRF

PredRF <- predict(modelRF,testingOne)
confRF <- confusionMatrix(PredRF,testingOne$classe)
plot(confRF$table,color = confRF$byClass, cex=.5,main = paste("Accuracy% =",100*round(confRF$overall['Accuracy'], 4)))
```

(iii). method = Support Vector Machine
```{r SVM, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(1990)
library(kernlab)
modelSVM <- ksvm(trainingOne$classe ~ ., data = trainingOne, type= "nu-svc",nu=0.1)
PredSVM <- predict(modelSVM,testingOne,type="response")
confusionMatrix(PredSVM,testingOne$classe)
```
Accuracy of the model =97.65%

5. Selected the random forest model to apply in finding the predictions of 20 test cases
```{r Quiz Answers, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

test_cases <- read.csv("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv",
                        na.strings = c("NA","#DIV/0!",""),header=TRUE, sep=",")
#Downloaded the test data from the given url, removed columns with blank cells and "#DIV/0!"

Answers_Quiz <- predict(modelRF, newdata=test_cases)
print(Answers_Quiz)
```
