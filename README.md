Coursera Practical Machine Learning Project and Quiz

Data Description:

HAR (human activity recognition) research has focused to predict "which" activity was performed at a specific point in time (like with the Daily Living Activities).

Weight Lifting Exercises dataset investigated "how (well)" an activity was performed by the wearer.

Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions:
> exactly according to the specification (Class A) # correct
> throwing the elbows to the front (Class B)
> lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C)
> lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D)
> throwing the hips to the front (Class E)

Participants were supervised by an experienced weight lifter to make sure that all participants could easily simulate the mistakes*

Safe and controlled exercises by using a relatively light dumbbell (1.25kg).
